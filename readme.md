## Important Stuff
*	Vim: .vimrc and vim plugins/colours/etc. folder

	My .vimrc file is a conglomeration of a lot of little tips and tricks that I found from many others&rsquo; .vimrcs. Thank you for making my &lsquo;vimitiation&rsquo; a little easier.
	I have a only few different plugins installed, namely snipMate, clang_complete, and surround.vim. I have a few colour schemes, and a few different file indentation and syntax files.

*	Bash: .bash_profile

	The file is also a comglomeration of bits and pieces I&rsquo;ve found on the &rsquo;net. I have a minimal prompt consisting of username, current directory, and git branch (if applicable).

## Not So Important Stuff
*	.ackrc: basic file to colourise the output of ack
*	.siegerc: default settings for siege
